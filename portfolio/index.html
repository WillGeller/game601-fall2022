        Blow-Fish! Is a variation on the classic Go Fish game. Two or more players compete to make sets of
        four matching cards. Each player takes their turn by asking their opponent for a specific card to
        complete these sets, and if they donâ€™t have it in hand, a card is drawn. Certain rules have been
        added that diverge from the classic Go Fish game to make the game-play more dynamic and
        unpredictable.

        Surviving Salyut7 is a collaborative survival game. Players take the role of astronauts aboard a space
        station. A catastrophic event has damaged the spacecraft and the surviving astronauts need to rebuild
        and maintain life support systems to stay alive. The goal is to survive until the rescue team arrives,
        managing vital resources and maintaining the ship

        For most of my coding exercizes I experimented with interactice and animated art. This piece, which I am most

        gives the user many different perspectices of box-art, swiftly transitioning in size and color as you pan across

        For my final project I am building a cross-platform version of a pong game.
        I wanted to pay homage to one of the first graphic based video games to release on the classic Atari arcade
        system, Pong.
        <br><br>
        While Pong is a fairly simple game, I wanted to test the limits of being able to build a game for various
        platforms/devices, and support multiple input types. I am doing all of my development within a Linux environment
        on a Chromebook. Chromebooks also natively run Android apps so I am able to live preview my game in a proper
        build target. In addition, I own a small handheld device, the Retroid Pocket 3, that runs Android and is
        intended for retro game emulation. The handheld has a touchscreen, and built in joystick and gamepad controls.
        Since it runs Android apps I am also able to live preview my game on this handheld device as I am developing the
        game.
        Input controls are touch or mouse for selecting options on the menus, and controlling the paddle up and down.
        I am building support for keyboard arrow keys and gamepad D-stick/Joystick for controlling the paddle movement.
        In addition there are various special moves that will be triggered with keys on the keyboard or other buttons on
        the gamepad.
